# Makeover Monday (MoM) - Week 46
**US Advertisement Buys**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## My Approach for Week 46
The original visualization did it's job, I think, but the color pallete was busy and distracting.  My approach was teh simplify, allowing the user to examine the ad buy trends over time, but also to see critical statistics for each medium.
